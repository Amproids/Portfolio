                <h3>Quick Summary</h3>
                <p1>My name is Andrew Parry, I'm a programmer from Utah. I'm hoping to be a game dev. I always found programming amazing and I want to make stuff that other people can enjoy. Starting with small stuff on scratch and working my way up to my own systems and more ambitious projects. I hope you find this website entertaining and that you stay a while!</p>

                <h3>Growing Up</h3>
                <p1>I grew up in Utah, nice place. The air is a little thin and it's dry, so the weather is pretty all over the place. Really cold winters, really hot summers. But it was a good place to grow up. Lots of variety and lots of opportunity to learn. <br><br></p1>
                <p1>I went on a lot of camping trips and played a lot outside growing up. When I was younger and first learned about video games that was pretty cool. I first played on the PlayStation2. Mafia 2 and Crash Badicoot 3 were big ones I remember. Later on I learned about flash games on sites like Armor Games, Game Sloth, and Coolmathgames. And even later on, I got into PC games like Warcraft 3, Halo 1, and Lego Chess. (that was a fun one.)</p1>

                <h3>First Programs</h3>
                <p1>I started programming in the 7th grade, starting on scratch. I really really enjoyed it although I wasn't very good at first. I'll try to put some of my older projects on the site if I can embed it. A year or two later I learned python. I liked that one a lot more. And I tried making a game on there as well but it was a lot less sucessful. and since then I haven't focused as much on making games.<br><br></p1>
                <p1>I learned more about websites, web servers, minecraft mods, and very recently, JavaScript. So now I feel like I have enough confidence to really work on a proper website. Hopefully I can add some more bells and whistles as I go along too. ;)</p1>
